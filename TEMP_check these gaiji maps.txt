I'm kinda new to this sort of thing, but this website seems useful https://glyphwiki.org/
this might be helpful for those math symbols https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols
NOTE: add the above info to a comment in the main code, or maybe the gaiji map file itself

shoui: might want to check these in your gaiji maps for other dicts as well

svg / old mapping / example entry headword / reading // comments
E16E.svg / 梶 / 当たる・中る / あたる // looks like 楫 to me
B45B.svg / 穴 / 穴冠 / あなかんむり // I'd rather drop to svg, if there isn't unicode for the radical
B45C.svg / 雨 / 雨冠 / あめかんむり // I think it's this ⻗
AF7C.svg / 𥫱 / 𥫱・篅 / いざる // AFAICT 𥫱 can be used for いざる, but it looks like they are using 𥫬
A53D.svg / 莔 / 莔麻 / いちび // I think they are technically using this codepoint 苘 https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/chunichidaijiten_qing3b364 , which doesn't suprise me, as the dict seems to prefer that sort of thing. maybe using 莔 instead would be of more practical use..? I'm inclined to use what they indended though
E3F8.svg / 入 / 入頭 / いりがしら // unless we use 全 and force a font from a different region, I think the only option is to drop to svg https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/u5168
B652.svg / 朮 / うけらが花 / うけらがはな // it's this 𦬸 https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/u26b38
B565.svg / Ｌ / L・l / エル // They clearly don't want it to be a plain old L for some reason? Not that hot on my o-chem (maybe ask cailey), but AFAICT you can use use plain old L and D for this concept (I'm googling levorotatory, 鏡像異性体, etc). Looking at image in 鏡像異性体 def as a reference, I think they simply want the font size a bit smaller, which we can do with struct cont
B55B.svg / Ｄ / L・l / エル // ditto
E6C1.svg / 煕 / 王公族 / おうこうぞく // bit tricky to find, but it's this 𤋅
B561.svg / Ａ / 外積 / がいせき // They've got fancy math symbols for this! 𝑨 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols#Latin_letters
B562.svg / Ｂ / 外積 / がいせき // ditto, 𝑩
A337.svg / レ / 返り点 / かえりてん // I'm just going to upper align this and call it a day
B47B.svg / 餕 / 迦陵伽・Kaliṅga / カリンガ // wasn't easy but I found it 𩜁 https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/u29701
AF51.svg / 运 / 簡体字 / かんたいじ // Thinking it's actually this 远
E213.svg / 革 / 黄威 / きおどし // Think it's simply 韋 ? Maybe they forgot to un-gaiji it
E1E7.svg / null / 貴種流離譚 / きしゅりゅうりたん // 謫. Not sure why it was NULL'd; looks like they forgot to add it or something in the 6th ed
DD53.svg / 牙 / 牙偏 / きばへん // technically the corrrect codepoint, but it needs to be kept as svg due to the context of the definition, unless we can force a different font
B050.svg / 蔥 / 行者葫 / ぎょうじゃにんにく // think it's ok, but I'm not sure
E565.svg / ＊ / 鏡像異性体 / きょうぞういせいたい // imma <sup> this (can just add html right into the gaiji file like with <strike>)
A971.svg / 𑑛 / 管朱引 / くだしゅびき // I think ▯ (U+25AF : WHITE VERTICAL RECTANGLE) is more fitting, reading the 管朱引 def
B821.svg / Ⅷ / 血液凝固因子 / けつえきぎょうこいんし // should be roman numeral 13 not 8, but AFAICT that doesn't exist in unicode... simply going to drop to svg so it looks nice, rather than trying to pidgeon hole something https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/search?q=Roman+Numeral#characters
AD6A.svg / 玄 / 闕画・欠画 / けっかく // I think 𤣥 is the closest codepoint, but I think they intend to show 玄 sans the last stroke, rather than the character 𤣥? 𤣥 also lacks jp font support, so it shows up in a different style. Would make the def not as clear. Droping to svg
E1AF.svg / 蘰 / けり / // looks like 縵
B34D.svg / 𦬇 / 𦬇 / ささてんぼだい // I think it's this 𬻋 https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/shincho-09970 , but it's not in any of my fonts so svg it is
DD4E.svg / 〄 / ジスマーク / // AFAICT 〄 specifically refers to the old jis symbol, and the new one isn't in unicode yet, so dropping to svg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Industrial_Standards
chou.svg / 朓 / 謝脁 / しゃちょう // why did they gaiji this even though it's in the headword lol??? the file has a non-generic name too. Weird. Anyway, looks like it's 脁
A76A.svg / 顖 / 顖門 / しんもん // not 100% sure 顖 is what is in the svg, but 顖門 is certainly a thing, so good enough I guess
B446.svg / 祹 / 世宗 / せいそう // think it's 裪
E0DF.svg / … / 長ける・闌ける / たける // this 誹
AF58.svg / 王 / 玉偏 / たまへん // this ⺩
AA3B.svg / 驇 / 驇 / たり // this 騺
B651.svg / テータ / テータ関数 / テータかんすう // they have unicode for that ϑ (though honestly using テータ would make the entry more searchable...) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols
E1EA.svg / 謗 / 閉めの事 / とじめのこと // they changed it to 譏 in the 7th ed
E210.svg / 鄭 / 杜甫 / とほ // they use 鞏 in 7th ed. But why did they gaiji this, they use it earlier in the def lol
AF2F.svg / 虍 / 虎冠 / とらかんむり // drop to svg. seems 虍 does look like the svg/radical in certain fonts? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_141 but not in shueitai at least, which is why they use gaiji
A16A.svg / F / は / might be a reason it's stylized this way. compare to L and D. might need to reevaluate those too.
AE77.svg / 䌇 / 糄䌇 / ひめ // it's this 𥻨
A824.svg / 䃾 / 袘・䃾 / ふき // I almost missed that; should be 𧘱
B32F.svg / 不 / 白不子 / ペイトンツ // Kinda torn on this. I think the svg is of 𣎴? but 白𣎴子 gets no hits, as opposed to 白不子. But clearly there is a reason the dict authors didn't simply use 不. Maybe I'll go ask the chinese department at uni lol
B330.svg / 繃 / ペテン / // drop to svg. looks like 弓+幷 but I can't find it. they do something interesting here though https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/382075230
AF3D.svg / 土 / 偏 / へん // can't find; dropping to svg. But I mean, if you look at the def for 土偏 they just use 土 there, so I guess it doesn't really matter.
AF3E.svg / 木 / 偏 / へん // ditto
